# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request.

To set this list apart from and complement the excellent [Solar Docs](https://github.com/Solar-network/docs), awesome-solar is a specially curated list for high-quality, actively maintained Solar resources.

- List items should be sorted *alphabetically*;
- Each item should be limited to one link;
- The link should be the name of the website, tool, package or project;
- Items containing Solar/SXP in link or title that are not operated by the team, MUST be classified as unofficial;
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional;
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line and end with a punctuation mark;
- At least 3 items are needed to create a new category, and at least 2 to create a subcategory;
- The package or project had to be maintained under **open source license** ( *we make a brief review of the code before the link enters the list* ), [see list of allowed licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical);
- A template for your pull request can be found [here](https://github.com/Bx64/Awesome-Solar/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md), this is a required format.

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standards

To be on the list, project repositories should adhere to these quality standards (https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ **github_user** / **github_repo**):

- Code functions as documented and expected
- Generally useful to the wider community of Solar
- Actively maintained
  - Regular, recent contributions
  - Or, for finished projects, issues and (pull) requests are responded to
- Stable or progressing toward stable
- Thoroughly documented English language, so everyone is able to understand the project's intention and how it works

## Maintainers

To make sure every PR is checked, we have [team maintainers](MAINTAINERS). Every PR MUST be reviewed by at least one maintainer before it can get merged.

The maintainers will review your PR and notify you and tag it in case any
information is still missing. They will wait 14 days for your interaction, after
that the PR will be closed.


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes contributions fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!
